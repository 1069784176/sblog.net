# sBlog.Net

In a very few words, sBlog.Net is a minimalistic blog engine. This project was heavily inspired by wordpress, though there are a lot more to 
come in the following days! You will be able to do all of the normal activities that you could do in a blog like adding a post or page, 
adding categories or tags, adding additional authors and many more. If I have to describe sBlog.Net in a single sentence, I would say,

"For the love of asp.net mvc and wordpress"

To get started, refer to this short article! You just need an instance of Visual Studio 2010 with ASP.Net MVC 3, MS SQL server (express 
should also be fine) and optionally IIS.

Thanks for trying out sBlog.Net!
